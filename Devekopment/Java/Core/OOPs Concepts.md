In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as **inheritance**, **data binding**, **polymorphism**, etc.

**Simula** is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.

**Smalltalk** is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.

The popular object-oriented languages are [Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial), [C#](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-tutorial), [PHP](https://www.javatpoint.com/php-tutorial), [Python](https://www.javatpoint.com/python-tutorial), [C++](https://www.javatpoint.com/cpp-tutorial), etc.

The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, for example, object, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
